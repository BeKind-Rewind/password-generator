# password-generator

Given some basic starting code, I built the functionality of the password <br>
generator through adding code to the javascript.
<br>
I started by marking the steps needed to achieve the targets outlined in <br>
the original unsolved README.md 
<br>

Issues to tackle: <br>

1. setting up arrays for upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters <br>
   [event listener "click" was already established in the code.]
2. setting up input for length of password
3. setting up prompts to use or not use each attribute
4. setting up DOMS
5. entering input ouside of parameters gives alert to error, returns and resets to original 
6. must choose at least 1 type
7. display password
